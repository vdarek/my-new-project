# Building AI project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

I've designed my project to solve a problem regarding energy use. The key idea is to, with the helpof AI solutions, estimate the optimal time for using electricity. This solution would be helpful for using the total capacity of for exampel windmills. The application would be such that it automatically starts electronic machines in households during times when the wind is strong and producing excess energy. This could maximize the usage of windpower while lowering the costs for people who uses energy at the right time.

## Background

This would be a way to help people to use energy when the timing os most sufficient and the energyproduction is high. It would also lower the need for energy storage. The solution could be used on a daily basis by for example putting on the laundy machine when the energy production is high, also lowering the costs. The topic is interesting because it is great way to make the energy consumption as sufficient it can be.
Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?


## How is it used?

A processor would with the help of AI estimate the time of the day when the energy production is at its best. The system would be supported by a refressions with a large amount of variables that could affect the energy production (for example time, weather, season, spot of windmills). The users would be anyone who has a electricity contract that is following the spotprice of electricity. For example a customer with a spotcontract from electricity company X could buy this device as an addition to the contract in order to save in the bills and to optimise the timing of cheap energy.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data would be built on historical estimates of how productive the windmills has been during different circumstanses. The data would in addition continuously build on itself by observing the current situation.


## Challenges

The project does not make people use less energy and the amount of consumption would stay the same, it only optimises when to use energy. Therefore, making consumption cheaper for customers.

## What next?

By constantly adding more independent variables to the estimation model, it could continuously start estimating better when to consume energy.

## Acknowledgments

Thought of this during a time when I was selling energy contracts and don't know if some company is using a model such as this.
